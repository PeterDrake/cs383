# Overview
Before you can tell a computer how to do a thing, you have to have a clear understanding of how to do it yourself. This assignment (from [Sedgewick & Wayne](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)) asks you to perform the insertion operation on red-black trees, probably the most complicated data structure we will see in this class.


Draw the red-black tree that results when you insert the keys E A S Y Q U T I O N, in that order, into an initially empty tree.

Create a sequence of pictures of the tree, one after each key is inserted. The last picture should therefore contain all ten keys. You can use a computer drawing system or draw by hand and then scan in your pictures. Be sure to distinguish between red and black nodes, ideally using color, but in a pinch by shading the black nodes. Make sure the keys are legible.

**This is an individual assignment. You are meant to create the diagrams on your own. You are welcome to discuss *ideas* with other students (including on the class email list), but don't look at their diagrams or show them yours.**

# Hints

After each step, verify that the tree contains every key inserted so far (and no duplicates), it is a valid binary search tree, and it is a valid left-leaning red-black tree.

# Optional Challenge Problems

Learn how to delete nodes from a left-leaning red-black tree and add a sequence of additional trees that results from deleting the keys Q U E S T, in that order, from the tree produced in the main assignment.

# What to Hand in

Submit all of your drawings in one file called red_black. (It might be a Google doc, a PDF, or even a JPG if you did them all on paper and then took a photo.)
