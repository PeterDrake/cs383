# Overview

This is another assignment where you deepen your understanding of an algorithm by performing it by hand.

Given the string `'mississippi'`:

1. Draw the tree for a Huffman code.
1. Give the sequence of bits that encode the message itself. (In a real compression situation you would also need to store or transmit the tree itself, but skip that here.)

**This is an individual assignment. You are meant to create the diagrams and bits on your own. You are welcome to discuss *ideas* with other students (including on the class email list), but don't look at their diagrams or bits or show them yours.**

# Hints
There is more than one correct answer.

A correct answer for the second part has 21 bits.

# Optional Challenge Problems

Write code that can:
* Given a message, return a dictionary of codes (mapping characters to strings of bits) and the encoded message
* Given a code dictionary and a string of bits, return the original message

Include unit tests to demonstrate that your code is correct.

# What to Hand in
Hand in a single document containing:

1. An image of your tree, which you can draw by hand or using an electronic tool.
1. The bits encoding the message itself.
