# Stacks
* [Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/stacks.md)
* Concept
* Python lists as stacks
  * Analysis

# Queues

* Concept
* Python lists as queues
  * Analysis
* collections.deque
  * Analysis

# Sets
* [Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/sets.md)
* Abstract data type
  * Element order doesn't matter
  * No duplicates
  * add, remove, contains
* One side of class implements with array-based structure, the other with linked
* Analyze each
* Python sets
  * Foreshadow: implemented with hash tables, which we'll see later

# Dictionaries
* Keys and values
* Python dicts
